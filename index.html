        <h2>The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're
afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the
future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came
here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this
phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them
to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without
rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where
anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.</p>
